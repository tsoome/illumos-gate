.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In uchar.h
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

header provides support for the C11 Unicode utilities.
The types and functions provide means for working with data encoded as
UTF-16 and UTF-32.
.Pp
The
.In uchar.h
header defines the following types:
.Bl -tag -width Vt
.It Vt char16_t
An unsigned integer that can represent 16-bit characters, generally a
single single UTF-16 code unit.
A Unicode code point may be one or two UTF-16 code units due to
surrogate pairs.
.It Vt char32_t
An unsigned integer that can represent 32-bit characters, generally a
single UTF-32 code unit.
.It Vt size_t
An unsigned integer that represents the size of various objects.
This can hold the result of the
.Sy sizeof
operator.

The
.In uchar.h
header also defines the following functions which are used to convert
between
.Vt char16_t
and
.Vt char32_t
sequences and other character sequences:
.Bl -tag -width cr16rtomb
.It Xr c16rtomb 3C
Convert
.Vt char16_t
sequences to multi-byte character sequences.
.It Xr c32rtomb 3C
Convert
.Vt char32_t
.It Xr mbrtoc16 3C
Convert multi-byte character sequences to
.Vt char16_t
sequences.
.It Xr mbrtoc32 3C
Convert multi-byte character sequences to
.Vt char32_t
sequences.
