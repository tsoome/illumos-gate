/*
 * Common definitions for dealing with Unicode.
 *
 * UTF-16 encodes data as a series of two byte values. However, there are more
 * than 16-bit of code points. Code points inside of the first 16-bits are
 * referred to as existing in the 'basic multilingual plane' (BMP). Those
 * outside of it are in the 'supplementary plane'. When such a code point is
 * encountered, it is encoded as a series of two uint16_t values.
 *
 * A value which is up to 20 bits (the current limit of the unicode code point
 * space) is encoded by splitting it into two 10-bit values. The upper 10 bits
 * are ORed with 0xd800 and the lower 10 bits are ORed with 0xdc00.
